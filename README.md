# Bank Customer Churn Prediction Model

Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn for a bank using machine learning techniques, with a focus on lazy predict for model selection and evaluation. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers cease their relationship with a company or service provider.

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can identify customers who are likely to churn. By identifying these customers early on, the bank can take proactive measures to retain them, such as offering personalized incentives or improved customer service.

Methodology
  Data Collection: Gather relevant data from the bank's database, including customer demographics, transaction history, and any other relevant features that might influence churn.

  Data Preprocessing: Clean the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features as necessary. This step ensures that the data is suitable for modeling.

  Feature Engineering: Create additional features that might be indicative of churn, such as average transaction amount, frequency of transactions, length of relationship with the bank, etc.

  Model Building: Utilize lazy predict to quickly evaluate the performance of various machine learning algorithms on the dataset. Lazy predict is a convenient tool that automates the model selection and evaluation process,     allowing us to quickly identify promising models for further tuning.

  Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the selected models using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Choose the model with the highest performance for deployment.

  Deployment: Deploy the selected model in a production environment where it can be used to predict customer churn in real-time.
